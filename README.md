ShopNifty is a web app which simplifies clothes shopping! Simply link any image on the main search screen and receive visually similar results from popular online sites that vend articles of clothing. With one click of a button, receive dozens of query results, including name, image, price, and domain, for visually similar items of clothing across different websites.

Uses Microsoft's Computer Vision API to process and tag images for visual similarity, and Webhose, a web scraping API, to collect data across multiple sites for images visually similar to the user's desired input image. Parses and outputs resulting query data in a user-friendly format.
